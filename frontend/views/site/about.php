					(pronounced Jaa Nee Koe) is borrowed from the root meaning Gini

					dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of a
					nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measure of income
					inequality typically seen in the gini index.

					<h2>WE MEASURE RISK DIFFERENTLY THAN BANKS & FICO</h2>
					<p>The coefficient varies between 0, which reflects complete
						equality and 1, which indicates complete inequality (where one
						person has all the income or consumption, and all others have
						none). We invert our prices for our products accordingly because
						we believe the TRUE risk is not grounded in access to capital with
						high FICO score for BIG stores and wealthy consumers but in income
						equality for the middle-class and poor working man and woman with
						low FICO scores and small mom and pop stores and sole
						proprietorships.</p>

				<p>So for example the credit card association's stale and outdated
					risk assessment charges a supermarket (where you the member are
					really the people who are paying) a fee of 0.95 + .15 p/transaction
					extra provided the supermarket's sales are less than 750 million
					USD annually (the corner store). On the other hand, the card
					association's might charge a fee of just 0.70 +15 p/transaction
					provided the supermarket sales are greater than 6 Billion annually
					(Walmart, Safeway, etc.) At Ginicoe we believe that the corner
					store earning less than $750 million annually should pay less than
					Walmart earning greater than 6 Billion annually, so we invert our
					prices for our products accordingly because we believe the TRUE
					risk is not grounded in access to capital for BIG stores but in
					income equality for the working man and woman - and you, our
					members who ultimately are the one's paying these fees. This is
					therefore how we at Ginicoe measure risk and thus price our
					products accordingly. This is another way we are uniquely better.
					After all, our political systems have failed miserably on the issue
					of rising inequality and social mobility. Common sense tells us
					that income inequality retards growth. After all, if we are in a
					Global economy seen for example as a NASCAR race, there is
					absolutely no way we can win the race if only 4-cyclinders are
					allowed to run where the world is running on all 8-cyclinders. Here
					the cylinders represent you, the consumer. All our citizens must be
					included to win the race!</p>

				<p>The solutions must be in empowering ALL consumers and merchants.
					This holds particularly true since 75% of the United States economy
					is consumer driven based on consumption. Emphasis is placed on the
					South Eastern and Industrial Midwest of the United States where
					social mobility is at its lowest. We are only as strong as our
					weakest link. These systemic and institutional barriers to the
					middle-class and upper class strata must be addressed at every
					instance available and in every institution and system throughout
					our lives. You may elect to read more about income equality on your
					own and perhaps start with John Cassidy's publication citing
					American Inequality in Six Charts in the New Yorker Magazine here:

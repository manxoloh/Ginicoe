<h4>Types of Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We collect three basic types of information - personal information,
	anonymous information, and biometric facial recognition (BFR)
	information - and we may use personal, anonymous, and BFR information
	to create a fourth type of information, aggregate information.</p>

We collect the following categories of information:
<ul>
	<li>Registry event information you provide when you create an account,
		including your first name and surname, credit and/or debit cards,
		facial image, your phone (or mobile) number, driver's license number,
		country of residence, gender, height, weight, color of hair, style of
		hair, handedness, color of eyes, distinguishing facial tattoos,
		distinguishing facial piercings, date of birth and age, email address,
		username and password.</li>
	<li>If you choose not to provide personally identifiable information
		(PII) we may not be able to provide you with requested products,
		services, or information.</li>
	<li>Transaction information you provide when you purchase or return a
		product or service from us or our affiliate merchants, card issuers,
		health care, government benefit agencies, educational services, or
		similar points of interaction whether on our sites or through our
		applications, including your postal address, telephone number and
		payment information.</li>
	<li>Information you provide in public forums on our sites and
		applications.</li>
	<li>Information sent either one-to-one or within a limited group using
		our message, chat, email, post or similar functionality, where we are
		permitted by law to collect this information</li>
	<li>Information you provide to us when you use our sites and
		applications, our applications on third-party sites or platforms such
		as social networking sites, or link your profile on a third-party site
		or platform with your enrollment account.</li>
	<li>Location information when you visit our sites or use our
		applications, including location information either provided by a
		mobile device interacting with one of our sites or applications, or
		associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to
		process this information.</li>
	<li>Usage, viewing and technical data, including your device identifier
		or IP address, when you visit our sites, use our applications on
		third-party sites or platforms or open emails we send</li>
</ul>
<h4>How We Collect Your Information</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Ginicoe supports The Consent Act for subscribers to proactively
		OPT-IN not opt-out. Put another way, upon registration and enrollment,
		you are OUT of ALL third party interactions outside of our General
		Business Purpose, until YOU change your profile.</li>
	<li>We collect information you provide to us when you request products,
		services or information from us or our affiliate merchants, card
		issuers, health care, government benefit agencies, educational, or
		similar points of interaction vendors, register with us, participate
		in public forums or other activities on our sites and applications,
		respond to customer surveys, or otherwise interact with us or our
		affiliate merchants, card issuers, or government benefit agencies,
		educational, or similar points of interaction vendors. Please keep in
		mind that when you provide information to us on a third-party site or
		platform (for example, via our applications), the information you
		provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or
		platform. The information we collect is covered by this privacy policy
		and the information the third-party site or platform collects is
		subject to the third-party site or platform's privacy practices.
		Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will
		NOT apply to our use of the information we have collected directly
		through our applications.</li>
	<li>We may connect information collected automatically with information
		we already have about you in order to accurately identify you as a
		enrollee or registered member. If we are able to identify you as a
		Ginicoe member, we may for example, link your information and activity
		on our website to your activity with an affiliate, partner, or
		merchant, card issuers, government benefit agencies, educational or
		similar points of interaction vendor. This allows us to provide you
		with a personalized experience regardless of the omni-channels that
		you select to interact with us - online, affiliate merchants, mobile,
		telephone, postal mail, fax, or brick-n-mortar physical merchants,
		etc.</li>
	<li>We collect information through technology, such as cookies, Flash
		cookies and Web beacons, including when you visit our sites and
		applications or use our applications on third-party sites or
		platforms. This information may also include the pages you visit on
		our site, which web address you came from, the type of
		browser/device/hardware you are using, purchasing information and
		checkout process search terms and IP-based geographic location. Please
		visit Online Tracking and Advertising for further information,
		including Do Not Track and how to disable cookies.</li>
	<li>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or
		supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically.
		We may also connect collected information with information we already
		have about you in order to identify and authenticate you as a new
		enrollee or existing Ginicoe member in good standing. If we are able
		to identify you as a Ginicoe member, for example, link your activity
		on our website to your activity in an affiliated merchant's store,
		card issuers, government benefit agencies, educational, or similar
		points of interaction vendor. This allows us to provide you with
		personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us -
		online, mobile, SMS Messages, affiliated merchants, etc. Local law may
		require that you authorize the third party to share your information
		with us before we can acquire it.</li>
</ul>
